# Titanic-Dataset-Kaggle-Competition-Submission

In this notebook I deploy a number of machine learning models to predict the probability of a passenger surviving the 1912 Titanic disaster based on a range of classifying parameters. 

Machine Learning Models:
* Logistic Regression Algorithm
* Naive Bayes Algorithm
* Random Forest Algorithm
* Support Vector Machine
* Artificial Neural Network using Keras

The project consists of the following steps:
* Retreiving the dataset from Kaggle.com
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering of the data into a suitable form for models
* Building and comparing machine learning models
* Submission of prediction data in a suitable form to Kaggle.com
